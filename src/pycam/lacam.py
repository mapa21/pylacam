"""LaCAM* algorithm implementation for Multi-Agent Path Finding.

This module implements a simplified version of the LaCAM* algorithm
(Lazy Constraints Addition search for MAPF), an anytime search-based
algorithm for solving MAPF problems with eventual optimality guarantees.

Algorithm Structure:
    LaCAM* uses a two-level search approach:

    - **High-level search**: Explores the configuration space (complete states
      of all agents' positions) in a depth-first search manner. Configurations 
      are evaluated using f = g + h, where g is the actual cost from the start,
      and h is a cos-to-go estimate.

    - **Low-level search**: For each high-level node, explores constraints on agent 
      movements to generate diverse successor configurations.

Key Properties:
    - **Anytime algorithm**: Can be interrupted at any time with a valid solution
    - **Eventually optimal**: Given sufficient time, converges to optimal solutions
      for sum-of-loss objective with cumulative transition costs
    - **Complete**: Always finds a solution if one exists

Implementation Notes:
    This is a **minimal educational implementation** using random action selection
    instead of PIBT for simplicity. While this maintains the core algorithmic
    structure and theoretical properties, it significantly reduces practical
    performance compared to the full LaCAM implementation with PIBT integration.
    With PIBT, have a look: https://github.com/Kei18/py-lacam/tree/pibt

class LaCAM:
    """LaCAM* solver for Multi-Agent Path Finding problems.

    LaCAM* is an anytime search-based algorithm that performs a two-level search
    in the configuration space to find collision-free paths for multiple agents.

    Algorithm Overview:
        **High-level search**: Conducts search over configurations (states of all 
        agents). Each configuration is evaluated using f = g + h, where g is the 
        actual cost and h is a heuristic lower bound.

        **Low-level search**: For each high-level configuration, explores movement 
        constraints to generate diverse successor configurations.

    Solution Modes:
        - **Anytime mode (flg_star=True)**: Continues refining the solution
          after finding an initial solution, eventually converging to optimal
          (given sufficient time). This is the default mode.
        - **First-solution mode (flg_star=False)**: Returns immediately after
          finding the first valid solution (suboptimal).

    Optimality Guarantee:
        When run in anytime mode with sufficient time, LaCAM* is **eventually
        optimal** for the sum-of-loss objective.

    Example:
        >>> from pycam import LaCAM, get_grid, get_scenario
        >>> grid = get_grid("map.map")
        >>> starts, goals = get_scenario("scenario.scen", N=4)
        >>> planner = LaCAM()
        >>>
        >>> # Anytime mode: Get optimal solution (eventually)
        >>> solution = planner.solve(
        ...     grid=grid,
